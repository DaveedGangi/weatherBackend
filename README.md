## Weather API Backend

This Node.js application is a backend service that interacts with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data based on a user's search query. The data is stored in a local SQLite database and can be retrieved later. The application is built using Express.js for the server, SQLite for data storage, and Node.js built-in `fetch` API for making HTTP requests.

### Project Structure

- **`index.js`**: The main file that sets up the server, connects to the database, and defines the API routes.
- **`weather.db`**: The SQLite database file where the weather data is stored.

### Functionality

1. **Database Initialization**
   - When the server starts, it initializes a SQLite database connection and creates a `weather` table if it doesn't already exist. This table is used to store the weather data fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API.

2. **POST `/weatherSearch`**
   - This endpoint allows the client to search for weather information by sending a city name and an API key.
   - The server constructs a request URL using the search term and API key, then sends a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API.
   - If the API call is successful, the weather data is stored in the `weather` table as a JSON string.
   - The response to the client will confirm that the weather details were saved.

3. **GET `/weather`**
   - This endpoint retrieves the most recent weather data entry from the database.
   - The data is returned to the client in JSON format after being parsed from the string stored in the database.
   - If no data is found, the server responds with a message indicating that no weather data is available.

### Code Breakdown

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const cors = require("cors");
const path = require("path");
const { open } = require("sqlite");
const sqlite3 = require("sqlite3");

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use(cors());
```
- **Dependencies**:
  - `express`: Web framework for creating the server.
  - `cors`: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
  - `sqlite3` and `sqlite`: Used for connecting to and managing the SQLite database.
  - `path`: Utility for working with file and directory paths.

```javascript
let db;

const dbPath = path.join(__dirname, "weather.db");

const initializeDataBaseAndServer = async () => {
    try {
        db = await open({
            filename: dbPath,
            driver: sqlite3.Database,
        });

        await db.run(`
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS weather(
                id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
                weather JSON
            )
        `);

        app.listen(3000, () => {
            console.log("server running at http://localhost:3000/");
        });
    } catch (e) {
        console.log(`DB Error: ${e.message}`);
        process.exit(1);
    }
};

initializeDataBaseAndServer();
```
- **Database Initialization**:
  - Establishes a connection to the SQLite database.
  - Creates the `weather` table if it does not exist.
  - Starts the server on port 3000.
  - If the database connection fails, the server will log an error and exit.

```javascript
app.post("/weatherSearch", async (request, response) => {
    try {
        const { search, key } = request.body;

        const api = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${search}&units=metric&APPID=${key}`;
        const options = {
            method: "GET",
        };

        const fetchApi = await fetch(api, options);
        const weather = await fetchApi.json();
        console.log(weather);

        if (fetchApi.ok === true) {
            const insertWeatherQuery = `
                INSERT INTO
                    weather(weather)
                VALUES
                    (
                        '${JSON.stringify(weather)}'
                    );
            `;
            await db.run(insertWeatherQuery);

            return response.json({
                message: "weather details saved",
            });
        } else {
            return response.json();
        }
    } catch (error) {
        response.send(error.message);
    }
});
```
- **POST `/weatherSearch`**:
  - Receives the city name (`search`) and API key (`key`) from the client in the request body.
  - Sends a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API using the provided city name and API key.
  - If the API call is successful, the weather data is stored in the `weather` table as a JSON string.
  - Returns a confirmation message to the client if the data was successfully saved.
  - Catches and handles any errors, sending the error message back to the client.

```javascript
app.get("/weather", async (request, response) => {
    try {
        const getWeatherQuery = `
            SELECT
                *
            FROM
                weather
            ORDER BY
                id DESC
            LIMIT 1;
        `;

        const latestWeather = await db.get(getWeatherQuery);
        if (latestWeather) {
            response.send(JSON.parse(latestWeather.weather));
        } else {
            response.send("No weather data found");
        }
    } catch (error) {
        response.send(error.message);
    }
});
```
- **GET `/weather`**:
  - Retrieves the most recent weather entry from the `weather` table.
  - Parses the JSON string stored in the database and returns it to the client.
  - If no data is found, it responds with a message indicating the absence of weather data.
  - Catches and handles any errors, sending the error message back to the client.

### Usage

- **To search for weather data**:
  Send a POST request to `/weatherSearch` with the city name and API key in the request body.

- **To get the latest weather data**:
  Send a GET request to `/weather`.

### Error Handling

- The server includes basic error handling with `try-catch` blocks to manage exceptions during API calls, database operations, and request handling.
- Error messages are sent back to the client in case of failures, ensuring that the user is informed of any issues.

### Example API Request and Response

**POST Request**:
```http
POST http://localhost:3000/weatherSearch
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "search":"Siddipet",
    "key":"your_openweathermap_api_key"
}
```

**GET Request**:
```http
GET http://localhost:3000/weather
```

**Sample Response**:
```json
{
    "coord": {
        "lon": 78.85,
        "lat": 18.1
    },
    "weather": [{
        "id": 803,
        "main": "Clouds",
        "description": "broken clouds",
        "icon": "04d"
    }],
    ...
}
```
